LVM

•	LVM (Logical Volume Manager)-
In linux, LVM manages disk drives and any other storage device. 
The logical volume manager allows you to resize your partitions without having to modify the partition table on your hard disk. 
This is important when you want to expand a new disk partition versus migrating all or part of the file system to a new disk.

•	The storage structure for the LVM -
1. Linux Partitions :- Partitioning allows you to divide your hard drive into isolated sections, where each section behaves as its own hard drive. 

2. Physical Volumes :- Physical block devices or other disk-like devices (for example, other devices created by device mapper, like RAID arrays) are used by LVM as the raw building material for higher levels of abstraction. Physical volumes are regular storage devices. LVM writes a header to the device to allocate it for management.

3. Volume Groups :- LVM combines physical volumes into storage pools known as volume groups. Volume groups abstract the characteristics of the underlying devices and function as a unified logical device with combined storage capacity of the component physical volumes.

4. Logical Volumes :- A volume group can be sliced up into any number of logical volumes. Logical volumes are functionally equivalent to partitions on a physical disk, but with much more flexibility. Logical volumes are the primary component that users and applications will interact with.

•	LVM command-
pvcreate [devices] - To create a physical volume 
pvdisplay - To display the physical volume
vgcreate vgname [pv] - To create a volume group
vgdisplay - To display the volume group
lvcreate -n name -L [size] name - To create a logical volume
lvdisplay - To display the logical volume
